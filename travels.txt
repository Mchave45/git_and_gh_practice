By far my favorite vacation in recent years was a road trip to Santa Fe for one of Vanessa's horse shows last summer. It was the first season with her new horse, Navarone.
Navarone is a young Oldenburg from germany, that we were lucky enough to buy two years ago. This horse show was only the second out of state we have done together.
Santa Fe is one of our favorite places to go, we go there as a family every summer for Vanessa's birthday, so to have the chance go to a horse show was amazing.
We towed my parents RV, and stayed on premise, which were these super fancy polo grounds. Of course we weren't allowed to actually go on the polo field, but in between Vanessa's
rides, I would watch the polo players practice. We took time to go to see some art, and eat at great restaurants, but the best part was Vanessa scored some of the best scores of her life.
being able to experience this show with her, together was amazing. We had a flat tire on the RV, got stuck in Taos trying to find a place that could replace it, wandering the back roads home.
